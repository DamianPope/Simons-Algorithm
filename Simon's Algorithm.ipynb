    "This problem is actually related to (but is <i>not</i> identical to) an important early quantum algorithm: Simon's algorithm. It was created by Daniel Simon in 1994. It was the first ever quantum alogrithm that performed <i>exponentially better</i> than the best classical algorithm for the same problem. It also inspired Peter Shor to come up with his famous factoring algorithm (i.e., Shor's algorithm). The publication of Shor's algorithm led to an explosion in the growth of quantum computing. So, Simon's algorithm holds a special place in the history of quantum computing.  "
